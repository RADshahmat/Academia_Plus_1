To attain it's high aim the school expects, full co-operation of the students, parents
and guardians. The best of school training is seriously crippled unless the home
does its part. In order to secure all that is best in the education of the child,
maximum co-operation between the parents and the school authorities is necessary.
Parents are requested to see that their children spend at least two hours in the
evening in reading and writing. All parents are earnestly asked to ensure that the
ideals of courtesy and gentleness which are proposed to the children during school
hours are maintained at home.<br>
<br>
Parents should co-operate with the school`s efforts with total involvement to bring
about maturity in their children. This calls for a real understanding of the school's
philosophy. It means that parents should strive to become living examples of the
values taught to and expected of their wards. it means keeping the principal and
the concerned teacher informed of any special problems or unforeseen circumstances
necessary for a proper understanding and guidance of their ward. The school desires
to have your co-operation and close contact with teacher of your child in order
to develop an atmosphere that is conducive to better and effective education. This
diary is one of the link which bridges the home and the school. It is an effective
medium to attain total harmony/rapport between the home and school:-<br>

it is important that the children develop a habit of studying and working of their
own.<br>
<br>
• Attention of parents is drawn to the fact that criticism of the teacher or school
in the presence of their children should be scrupulously avoided, because it cause
the students to loose respect for their teachers with the consequent failure to
learn from them, it further retards his/her progress. Should you have a legitimate
complaint, please meet the principal at once or write in a seperate letter addressed
to her. She will look into these matters personally.<br>

and not to the class teachers and all correspondence between the school and parents
must be done through the principal.<br>
<br>
• Parents are not allowed to see their children or meet the teachers during school
hours.<br>
<br>
• Private tuitions are discouraged.<br>
<br>

classes easily by a certain amount of regular conversation at home.<br>

everyday. No extra books are allowed.<br>
<br>

fountain pens, transistor, radios, tape recorders, calculator ,and jewellery. In
